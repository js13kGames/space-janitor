# Project Space Janitor
This is the repo containing the source code for the game that's been submitted to the [JS13K game jam](https://js13kgames.com/)

## Description
This is our first ever deployed game, so many things were learned and many bugs remain, but it is playable (for the most part). Known issue: player seemingly randomly gets to the game over state ... if anyone can see the bug, we'd love to hear about it!

## Running
Start by installing the dependencies: `npm install`, then run:
`npm start` for the development version, or
`npm run build` to generate the ZIP that was submitted. Open the zip and open the `index.[hash].html` in either Chrome or Firefox (those browsers were tested, but any modern browser *should* work)
